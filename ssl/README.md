# SSL 

[↩️ back](/README.md)

After you launch vagrant in this folder you can find Root CA
for generated ssl certificate you should use in development. 

Do not share it with anyone! 

Once you import `ca.crt` into your operating system certificates storage, 
auto generated SLL certificate for `https://itoffers.local` will become trusted
in you browsers.
