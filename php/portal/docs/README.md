# Hire in Social

[↩️ back](/README.md)

Main goal of this project is to let Recruiters quickly post job offers for IT talents, known also as Candidates. 
Posted offers become available for Candidates at one of supported channels. 

Both, Candidates and Recruiters must be satisfied and get the best possible experience. That's why Hire is Social does not force
Recruiters to provide salary ranges since it's not always possible. On the other hand, Candidates are looking only for 
fresh, not duplicated offers, that's why Hire in Social has a limit of offers that can be posted by single Recruiter in
time range.
