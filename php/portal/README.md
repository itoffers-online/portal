# System Setup

[↩️ back](/README.md)

Before you start make sure all dependencies are on place. Vagrant is recommended environment for local development and
all instructions in this readme are prepared for it.  

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ cd /var/www/portal/php/itoffers
$ composer install
$ composer assets:install
```

## Configuration

Check [.env.dist file](/php/itoffers/.env.dist) and create your own local copy:

```
$ cp /var/www/portal/php/itoffers/.env.dist /var/www/portal/php/itoffers/.env
```
 
## User interface

User interface is using [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/). Most javascripts are written directly in twig, in special
block `javascripts`, just like custom css are using `stylesheets` block. 

In order to rebuild bootstrap use 

```
composer assets:build
``` 
 
## Command Line Interface

All available CLI commands are defined in `composer.json` file, in scripts section.

### Test project

This command will execute whole testsuite at once, it will also clear all caches first.
Environment variables used in tests are defined in [.env.test](.env.test) file.

```
$ composer test
```

To check PHPUnit code coverage run:

```
$ composer test:coverage:unit
```

And open `./var/coverage/index.html` in your browser.
